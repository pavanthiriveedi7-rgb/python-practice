Task-1:
The E-commerce Receipt (Summing Data)
Imagine you have a shopping cart represented as a list of prices. You need to calculate the total cost and apply a tax.

code:
cart_prices = list(map(float, input("Enter item prices separated by space: ").split()))
sub_total = 0
for price in cart_prices:
    sub_total = sub_total + price
sales_tax_rate = float(input("Enter a tax rate (e.g., 0.07 for 7%):"))  #7% tax
tax_amount = sub_total * sales_tax_rate
total = sub_total + tax_amount
print(" RECEIPT  ")
print(f"subtotal: ${sub_total:.2f}")
print(f"Tax: ${tax_amount:.2f}")
print(f"Total: ${total:.2f}")


Task-2:

The Email Filter (Validation & Cleaning)
In software, we often get "dirty" data. Imagine a list of user-submitted emails where some are missing the "@" symbol. We want to find the valid ones.

code:
user_emails = list(map(str, input("Enter emails separated by space: ").split()))

valid_emails = []

for email in user_emails:
    if "@" in email:
        valid_emails.append(email)
        print(f"Verified: {email}")
    else:
        print(f"Discarded: {email}")

print(f"\nCleaned List: {valid_emails}")




Task-3:


Stock Alert System (Conditionals in Loops)
Imagine you are tracking stock prices. You want the program to "alert" you only when a price drops below a certain threshold.


code:
data = input("Enter company names and prices separated by space: ").split() 
stocks = {data[i]: float(data[i+1]) 
for i in range(0, len(data),2)}

buy_threshold = 800

for company, price in stocks.items():
    if price < buy_threshold:
        print(f"ALERT: {company} is a bargain at ${price:.2f}! Consider buying.")
    else:
        print(f"{company} is currently ${price:.2f} (Too expensive).")


Task - 4:

Divide even and odd numbers in any given list and print EVEN beside even numbers and ODD beside odd numbers(Even numbers together and odd numbers together)

code:



def sort_and_label_numbers(my_list):
    evens = []
    odds = []

    # Separate the numbers into two lists
    for num in my_list:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            evens.append(f"{num} EVEN")
        else:
            odds.append(f"{num} ODD")

    # Print evens first, then odds
    for entry in evens + odds:
        print(entry)

# Example Usage:
my_list = list(map(int,(input("Enter numbers separated by space: ")).split()))
sort_and_label_numbers(my_list)
