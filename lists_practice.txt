        Lists

Task 1:
 
The E-Commerce Shopping Cart
Scenario: You are building the checkout flow for Amazon. A user adds items, decides they don't want one, and then proceeds to checkout. Core Concepts: Adding (append), Removing (remove), Counting (len).

The Task:

Start with an empty list called cart.

The user clicks "Add" on some items. Add these to the list.

The user decides  to remove the one item unwanted is too expensive. Remove it from the list.

Add some new item to the list.

Print: "Your cart contains [X] items: [List of items]".




code:


cart = []


cart.append("Laptop")
cart.append("Mouse")
cart.append("Keyboard")


cart.remove("Mouse")

   # Add "HDMI Cable" to the list
cart.append("HDMI Cable")

#  Calculate the count
item_count = len(cart)

# print all items
print(f"Your cart contains {item_count} items: {cart}")



Task-2:

The "Daily Step Tracker" (Data Analysis)
Scenario: A fitness app (like Fitbit) records the number of steps a user takes every day for a week. You need to analyze this data. Core Concepts: Math functions (sum, max, min), Indexing.

The Task:

Create a list: steps .

Total: Calculate the total steps taken in the week.

Average: Calculate the average daily steps (Total / Number of days).

Best Day: Print the highest number of steps taken in a single day.

Lazy Day: Print the lowest number of steps taken.


code:


steps = [4000, 7000, 10000, 2000, 8000, 5000, 12000]

total_steps = sum(steps)
average_steps = total_steps / len(steps)
best_day = max(steps)
lazy_day = min(steps)
print(f"Total Steps: {total_steps}")
print(f"Average Steps: {average_steps}") 
print(f"Best Day: {best_day}")
print(f"Lazy Day: {lazy_day}")



Task -3:

The Customer Support Queue (FIFO)
Scenario: Customers are waiting in a chat queue to talk to a support agent. The first person to join the queue should be the first person served (First-In, First-Out). Core Concepts: pop(0) (removing from the front), append.

The Task:

Create a list queue .

New Arrival: joins the chat. Add them to the end.

Service: The agent is ready. Remove the first person from the list.

Status: Print who is currently at the front of the line .


code:




queue = ["User1", "User2", "User3"]

queue.append("User4")
print(queue)
current_user = queue.pop(0) 
print(f"Now chatting with {current_user}")
print(f"Next in line: {queue[0]}")
print(f"Full queue: {queue}")




Task-4:

The Text Editor "Undo" Button (LIFO)
Scenario: You are writing a text editor like Notepad. Every time the user types a word, it's saved. If they hit "Ctrl+Z" (Undo), the last word typed must be removed. Core Concepts: pop() (removing from the end), append.

The Task:

Start with actions .

Undo: The user hits undo. Remove the very last item  and print "Undid action".

Add it to the list.

History: Print the current list of active actions.



code:

actions = ["venkata","pavan","kumar"]

actions = ["venkata","pavan","kumar"]
last_action = actions.pop()
print(f"Undid action: {last_action}")
actions.append("tiruveedhi")

print(f"current: {actions}")



Task -5:

The Top 3 Scores (Sorting & Slicing)
Scenario: A video game needs to display the "Leaderboard" showing only the top 3 high scores from a list of hundreds of players. Core Concepts: Sorting (sort), Slicing ([:3]).

The Task:

Create a list of raw scores.

Sort: Sort the list in descending order (highest to lowest).

Hint: Use scores.sort(reverse=True).

Display: Create a new list called top_three that only contains the first 3 items of the sorted list.

Print: "The  winners are: [top_three]".



code:



scores = [50, 10, 90, 30, 100, 20, 80]
scores.sort(reverse=True)
top_three = scores[:3]
print(" Descending order: ",scores)
print(f" top three members are:{top_three}")
