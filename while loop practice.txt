Task 1: The Smart Thermostat (State Control)
Scenario: You are programming a smart thermostat. It needs to keep the heater running until the room reaches a target temperature.
Initial Temp: 18
Target Temp: 22



code:

current_temp = int(input("Enter your room temp.: "))
target_temp = int(input("Enter target room temp.: "))
increment = 0.5
print(f"Heater ON Initial temperature:{current_temp}C")
while current_temp < target_temp:
    current_temp = current_temp + increment
    print(f"Heating..current Temperature:{round(current_temp,1)}")
    
print("Target reached.Heater OFF..")




Task 2: The Digital Vault (Security)
Scenario: A user is trying to unlock a high-security folder. You must allow them to try the password, but for security, you must shut down the system after 3 failed attempts.
The Password: "Pavan999"
Requirement: * Ask for input.
If correct, print "Access Granted" and break.
If wrong, tell them how many attempts are left.
If they run out of attempts, print "System Locked."

code:

correct_password = "98765"
attempts = 0
max_trails = 3


while attempts<max_trails:
    entered_password = int(input("Enter your password(5 digits only): "))
    if entered_password == correct_password:
        print("Access Granted. Welcome to the valut.")
        break
    else:
        attempts = attempts + 1
        reamining = max_trails - attempts
        if reamining > 0:
            print(f"Incorrrect.you have to {reamining} attempts left..")
        else:
            print("SYSTEM LOCKED.Unauthorized access detected.")
        print("")




Task 3: The "Infinite" Shopping Cart
In this version, we start the total at 0 and keep the loop running until the user decides they are finished.

code:

total_bill = 0
item_price = input("Enter an item price (or type 'done' to finish): ")
print("   Welcome to the hotel.")
while item_price != "done":
    total_bill = total_bill + float(item_price)
    print(f"Current bill = ${total_bill}")
    print("-------------*******--------------")
    item_price = input("Enter an item price (or type 'done' to finish): ")
print(f"Final bill: ${total_bill}")
print("Thank you for coming to my hotel!")
